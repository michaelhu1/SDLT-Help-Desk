            The Student Digital Leadership Team is one of the three multidisciplinary leadership teams at HKIS. 
            <br>
            As a group, we aim to promote and apply technology in unique and innovative ways that are both relevant and beneficial to our school community.
            <br>
            Our team is comprised of two branches: the Digital Communication Alliance (DCA) and the Technical Advisory Board (TAB).
            <br>
            DCA members are responsible for all media-related tasks and serve the community by recording and live-streaming nearly all school events.
            <br>
            On the other end, TAB members aim to both educate others in programming, design, and creation, but also apply their own skills to projects that enhance and further the use of technology at HKIS.
            <br>
            Aside from fulfilling the responsibilities of their respective teams and contributing to initiatives, SDLT members are also expected to act as mentors and enthusiastic leaders within our community.
